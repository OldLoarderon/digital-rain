# Getting started with this piece of code

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
<br>
I know it isn't that much cost-effective as it renders each stream individually, giving its padding etc every single time, but that's fine with me.
<br>
If you care to show me how to make it better - I'm open for suggestions!


## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
